The Nova default scheduler present in OpenStack(an open standard cloud computing platform)uses worst fit algorithm and does not consider the workload characteristics of the requested virtual machine instance.The aim of this project is to implement a scheduling algorithm for efficient usage of Compute nodes in Cloud environment(open stack) using Predictive techniques.

Tools and Technologies used : OpenStack, machine learning, python
